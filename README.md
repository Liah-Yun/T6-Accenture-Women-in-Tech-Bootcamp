# Accenture ~ Women in Tech Bootcamp | SuperSavvy 

SuperSavvy AI Assistant is a Python program that utilises an external API to calculate projected superannuation balances. 
It considers factors such as age, annual salary, superannuation employer contribution rate, current superannuation balance, retirement age, wage inflation rate, and price inflation rate to estimate superannuation balances over time.

This Python code is a part of our successful project developed during the Women in Tech BootCamp held by Accenture. We are proud to announce that our project emerged as the winner in this prestigious competition.
